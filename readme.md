# Overview

This is a quick development template meant to speed up the scaffolding of Docker-containerized MEAN applications. There are three containers that can be run simultaneously using docker compose. First cd into the main folder:
 > $ cd mean-docker-template
 Then use Docker Compose
 > $ docker-compose up -d
 This will build the three containers if they don't already exist, then start them.
